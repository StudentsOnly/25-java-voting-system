## Exercise: Voting System with Set

#### Objective:

Practice using Set to simulate a simple voting system.

#### Description:

You are required to create a program that simulates a simple voting system using a Set. The program should allow users to cast votes for candidates, count the votes, display the vote count for each candidate, and exit the program.

#### Guidelines:

- Create a Set to store votes (strings representing candidate names).
- Implement a loop that displays a menu with the following options:
    - Cast a vote
    - Count votes
    - Display vote count
    - Exit

Depending on the selected option, perform the following tasks:

- To cast a vote, take input from the user for the candidate's name and add it to the Set.
- To count votes, retrieve the size of the Set.
- To display vote count, print the count for each candidate.
- To exit, terminate the program.
- Handle input validation to prevent errors when handling menu options.
